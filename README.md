# The-LifeStyle-Lab
Work-life balance is valued more than health benefits which makes sense because work-life score is closely related to how a person is performing and feeling. There are many issues people have come up with due to an uncontrolled work-life balance some of which are:
1. Personal relationships suffering 
2. Loss of productivity
3. Propelling burnout  
4. Mental health deterioration
5. Stress and anxiety

‘The lifestyle lab’ is a smart solution to this problem. This website allow users to take a test and assess their work-life balance and will help them evaluate their routine. 
The backend of the project is completed but the frontend is in need of some work. Any addition to the project is welcome from your side either in improving the backend or adding features to the frontend.
To run this project use the app.py file
